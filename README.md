# NeonateNasalAirwayEvaluator
This project is dedicated to the segmentation and quantitative analysis of the neonatal nasal airway using CT images. It encompasses measurements of pyriform aperture width, volume, regional volume, and cross-sectional area. along nasal cavity
Initially, the primary focus of this project was the analysis of CNPAS (Congenital Nasal Pyriform Aperture Stenosis), a rare obstruction in the nasal airway of neonates. However, the tools and methodologies developed are versatile and can be applied to analyze other aspects of the nasal anatomy in neonates.
